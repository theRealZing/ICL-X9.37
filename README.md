Project Description

This is a fork of the ICL-X9.37 from sbsen. This fork fixes an issue with EBCIDIC file reading. X9.37 is normally encoded as EBCIDIC,  but for some reason the original repository has an example that is ASCII encoded.

Although this is a full fork, I have no interest in the VB.net version of this. I do plan on enhancing the C# version though.

x9.37 Image Cash Letter viewer. Updated to C#.Net(VS 2010). Currently allows viewing and searching of X9 files, supports ASCII Encoding, Exporting the images to multiple single TIF and ICL File summary page is included for easy verification. 

VB.net project ignored in this fork.
